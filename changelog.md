**Here are any major  changes you have to do if you want to use an older version of Ubuntu.**

18.10
-----
Nothing so far.

18.04
-----
* Bluez 5.48 is bugged. Install 5.50 or newer. You can find PPA in a tagged release of this repo for Bionic Beaver.

16.10, 17.04, 17.10
-----
I have not used those versions.

16.04
-----
* Rofi from Ubuntu repository is ancient and themes will not work. Install at least 1.5.0 from Ubuntu 18.04.
* i3 is available but it's an old version that has some problems. Use official repository from i3 authors.
* Vifm is too old and configuration file from this repository will cause errors. Install at least version 0.9 from Ubuntu 18.04.
