i3 on Ubuntu Mate
--------------------------------
Tested on 18.04 (12 June 2018)

Install git, clone this repository and run `install.sh`.
This will install i3, configure Mate and also install 
some other useful applications.

i3bar is disabled in the configuration file and I use Mate panel instead,
so install this applet to get workspace indicator:
