i3 on Ubuntu Mate
--------------------------------
Master branch is tested only on the Ubuntu version I am currently using (18.10 as of writing this).
Whenever I switch to a new version, the tag is created for the old one so it is easy to find.

Install git, clone this repository and run `install.sh`.
This will install i3, configure Mate and also install 
some other useful applications.

i3bar is disabled in the configuration file and I use Mate panel instead,
so install this applet to get workspace indicator:
[mate-i3-applet](https://github.com/city41/mate-i3-applet)


Fan speed control:
```
NBFC
Run nbfc.sh from this repo
